Welcome to ExPRES' documentation!
==================================

ExPRES (Exoplanetary and Planetary Radio Emission Simulator) is a versatile tool that computes the observation
opportunities of planetary radio emissions, based on the radio source beaming patterns and the observer's location.
The code is described in details in :cite:`Louis:2019` and has been used in several papers for interpreting Earth-based
or space-borne  planetary radio emission observations (see, e.g., :cite:`Louis:2017bz,Louis:2017dl`).
