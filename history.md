#Version History

Each version of the code has seen new modules added and minor bugs fixed. Here is given a resume of the majors modifications. 

The first versions ([0.2.0](https://github.com/maserlib/ExPRES/tree/0.2.0) to [0.3.7](https://github.com/maserlib/ExPRES/tree/0.3.7))
of the ExPRES code were developed to predict and interpret the future observations of the NASA Juno space mission to Jupiter. 

Version [0.4.0](https://github.com/maserlib/ExPRES/tree/0.4.0) of the code allowed a generalization to Saturn and 
version [0.5.0](https://github.com/maserlib/ExPRES/tree/0.5.0) to exoplanets. For version 
[0.6.0](https://github.com/maserlib/ExPRES/tree/0.6.0), the code architecture has been completely redesigned and the production of 
3D movies has been added. The current stable version is 1.0 and allows, from JSON formatted \citep{JSON} input files, 
to produce the simulation results in CDF.

In Version [1.0.0](https://github.com/maserlib/ExPRES/tree/1.0.0), the input configuration file of the code is now a JSON file. 
From that version on, the code is available online.
